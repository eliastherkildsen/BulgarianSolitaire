In this assignment, you will model the game of Bulgarian Solitaire. 
The game starts with 45 cards. (They need not be playing cards. 
Unmarked index cards work just as well.) Randomly divide them into some number of piles of random size.
For example, you might start with piles of size 20, 5, 1, 9, and 10. I
n each round, you take one card from each pile, forming a new pile with these cards. 
For example, the sample starting configuration would be transformed into piles of size 19, 4, 8, 9, and 5. 
The solitaire is over when the piles have size 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.
(It can be shown that you always end up with such a configuration.)
In your program, produce a random starting configuration and print it. 
Then keep applying the solitaire step and print the result. Stop when the solitaire final configuration is reached.
